# Random-Image
Prank: C++ script that will display a random image from 3 images every 3 hours:

This script generates a random number between 0 and 2 every 3 hours, which corresponds to one of the 3 images. It then opens the image using the "start" command, which is a Windows command that opens a file with the default program associated with its file type.
Please note that this script will run indefinitely and will keep displaying the images in 3 hours intervals, you may want to add some kind of exit condition to the while loop.
Also, make sure that the images are located in the same folder as the script, or update the path accordingly.
